    "description": "My name is Micha Batelaan, and I am an enthusiastic Software Engineering student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br> With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I work on developing innovative software solutions.<br> I am eager to learn, driven, and always looking for ways to further expand my knowledge in IT.<br> Besides my studies, I enjoy taking on new challenges, such as with my hobbies of cooking, gardening, and making music.<br> I play the guitar, but I prefer listening to music over playing it myself.<br> I love to show my best in everything I do.<br> I excel at finding solutions to problems, thanks to my love for puzzles and my experience with IT service-related studies and internships.<br> Additionally, you will hopefully find me at the Friday afternoon drinks.<br> I enjoy a friendly atmosphere at work, and I am definitely not afraid to ask questions or help where needed.<br> <br><strong> This site is built with VUE.js </strong>"
